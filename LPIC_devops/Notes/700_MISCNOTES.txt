- Create container image through salt
- Set up macvlan networking
- Set up 3 instances: A web server with the logs on a volume, something to do queries to the webserver, and a logging container to do something with those logs on the volume
- Set up your own registry and describe how to do it!

Creating and testing your own symfony demo container:

mkdir symfonydemo
cd symfonydemo
vim Dockerfile

Put this in the Dockerfile as you know these are necessary:

FROM debian:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install curl php-symfony git -y
RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php && mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

To further investigate how to set up symfoiny demo, create an image from your Dockerfile and run bash into it so you can find out the next steps to have the image running:

#In the same directory as the Dockerfile:
docker image build . --tag symfonydemo:v1

#Launch image and run bash:
docker run -i -t symfonydemo:v1 /bin/bash

Remember to rebuild the image every time you change the Dockerfile!

When you're done with everything, how do you launch the instance again?

docker exec -it sad_hugle bash

docker exec --user root -it sad_hugle bash

docker run -d symfonydemo:v1

#Inside a docker machine, also doesn't work either

docker image pull redis:alpine
docker image pull russmckendrick/moby-counter
docker network create moby-counter

docker network inspect moby-counter #Hmmm...

docker container run -d --name redis --network moby-counter redis:alpine
docker container run -d --name moby-counter --network moby-counter -p 8080:80 russmckendrick/moby-counter

docker container ls

Interesting, the redis images exposes the redit port by default (erm, that makes sense)

Application should be available on localhost:8080

But how did the app know the address of the redis container?
If attempt to ping the redis application from the container, it works:

docker container exec moby-counter ping -c 3 redis

Does it have an entry for redis in the hosts file? :o
docker container exec moby-counter cat /etc/hosts

It doesnt. Very intriguing. What nameserver is being used?
docker container exec moby-counter cat /etc/resolv.conf

127.0.0.11, hmmm, I wonder if that's resolving our redis name?
docker container exec moby-counter nslookup redis 127.0.0.11

It is!

At this point the book creates another network and launches the applications gain:

docker network create moby-counter2
docker run -itd --name moby-counter2 --network moby-counter2 -p 9090:80 russmckendrick/moby-counter

We attempt to ping redis again and it doesn't work:
docker container exec moby-counter2 ping -c 3 redis
ping: bad address 'redis'

Another redit instance named redis2 is launched:
docker container run -d --name redis2 --network moby-counter2 --network-alias redis redis:alpine

Now the previous ping works:
docker container exec moby-counter2 ping -c 3 redis

PING redis (172.19.0.3): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.19.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.090 ms

Docker has some sort of internal, network-level name resolution that resolves names based on image names. You can see the names based on the instances that are running on a given network:

docker network inspect moby-counter2

To end this part of the book, stop and prune everything:

docker container stop moby-counter2 redis2
docker container prune
docker network prune

--- DOCKER MACHINE ---

Not covered on the scope of LPIC Devops, but I'll roll with it as it appears to be an interesting stepping stone in the Mastering Docker book.

----- PORTAINER -----
Not covered by LPIC, but this appears to be an interesting chapter of mastering docker regardless:

Pull the portainer image:
docker image pull portainer/portainer

Or... just directly launch a container and the image will be pulled:

docker container run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock portainer/portainer

It's all UI based, so not much to write about. Interacted with it as described by the book!

It goes along checking containers on localhost. Not that entertaining perhaps as all that info is easily accessible on the command line?

PORTAINER AND DOCKER SWARM

Now this looks more interesting. Launch a swarm with 1 node manager and 3 worker nodes as descrined on your notes in 702.2

Then point it to the swarm manager:
eval $(docker-machine env swarm-manager)

Then run this. This will launch portainer on the manager node.

docker service create \
--name portainer \
--publish 9000:9000 \
--constraint 'node.role == manager' \
--mount type=bind,src=/var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock \
portainer/portainer \
-H unix:///var/run/docker.sock

----- DOCKER FOR LOCAL DEV -----

This is from chapter 12 on the mastering docker book.

It starts describing local development with docker. To start things off, get the docker compose file located here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/russmckendrick/mastering-docker/master/chapter12/docker-wordpress/docker-compose.yml

I was (am) initially a bit confused regarding docker-compose file. Let's analyze it to improve our knowledge of docker-compose:

     1	version: "3"
     2
     3	services:
     4	  web:
     5	    image: nginx:alpine
     6	    ports:
     7	      - "8080:80"
     8	    volumes:
     9	      - "./wordpress/web:/var/www/html"
    10	      - "./wordpress/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"
    11	    depends_on:
    12	      - wordpress
    13	  wordpress:
    14	    image: wordpress:php7.1-fpm-alpine
    15	    volumes:
    16	      - "./wordpress/web:/var/www/html"
    17	    depends_on:
    18	      - mysql
    19	  mysql:
    20	      image: mysql:8
    21	      environment:
    22	        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "wordpress"
    23	        MYSQL_USER: "wordpress"
    24	        MYSQL_PASSWORD: "wordpress"
    25	        MYSQL_DATABASE: "wordpress"
    26	      volumes:
    27	        - "./wordpress/mysql:/var/lib/mysql"
    28	  wp:
    29	    image: wordpress:cli-php7.1
    30	    volumes:
    31	      - "./wordpress/web:/var/www/html"
    32	      - "./wordpress/export:/export"


There are three services here: web, wordpress, mysql and wp.

THE WEB CONTAINER:
- Regular nginx:alpine image
- Port 80 on the container gets exposed to port 8080 on the local host
- On the host machine, $LOCALDIR/wordpress/web gets mounted to /var/www/html inside the container.
- On the host machine, $LOCALDIR/wordpress/nginx.conf gets mounted to /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf inside the container
- It depends on the wordpress container.
- No explicit process is launched? Hmmm

THE WORDPRESS CONTAINER:
- Wordpress image.
- On the host machine, $LOCALDIR/wordpress/web gets mounted to /var/www/html inside the container
- This container runs php-fpm. It appears to serve php outside the web docker container? Ruh-roh.
- It depends on the mysql container

THE MYSQL CONTAINER:
- MySQL image
- Has a few environment variables to set up MYSQL settings
- $LOCALDIR/wordpress/mysql gets mounted to /var/lib/mysql in the container

THE WP CONTAINER
- This container just gets wordpress files and populates /var/www/html with them. It then doesn't stay running after it populates the volume.





Before going forward, let's visualize the docker-compose file with docker-compose-viz:

docker run --rm -it --name dcv -v $(pwd):/input pmsipilot/docker-compose-viz render -m image docker-compose.yml
