GIT TODO:
- Move the git.txt in learnings to a LPIC text file in it's corresponding section and get rid of that folder

DOCKER TODO:
- Study docker machine to launch an ansible server (full fledged vm with apt-get and so on)
- Make a reference sheet of dockerfile commands/entry types
- Go through some more Dockerfiles to understand further examples
- Do a workflow for docker things (create image, upload to docker hub, deploy swarm?)
- Note: Images can have depending child images! (such as a debian image)
- docker run -it: What does it mean?
- Revisit the docker container log thing you saw on mastering docker -- can you make that happen on apache too?
- On docker, it appears changes do not persist when running images (welp, that oughta be obvious)
- Nice (basic?) docker cheat sheet: http://blog.baudson.de/blog/stop-and-remove-all-docker-containers-and-images
- A topic for later: How do you monitor docker container resource usage? :o (with historical data, think nagios)
- How do you limit the size of a volume, and monitor usage? :o
- Revisit docker machine and use it to launch an amazon instance

- Explain containers, services and stacks conceptually (docker architecture?)
- How about a container to server custom vagrant boxes? That would be neat. Could be done on the orangepi even!


ANSIBLE TODO:
- Get a docker instance with ansible installed on it

VAGRANT TODO:
- Find a way to launch multiple, different machines at the same time!


OTHER TODO:
- This is not covered by the certification, but is very nice: https://12factor.net/

ON DOCKER VOLUMES, from the jenkins/docker CD book:

A very common approach to data management with Docker is to
introduce an additional layer in the form of data volume containers. A
data volume container is a Docker container whose only purpose is to
declare the volume. Then, other containers can use it (with the --
volumes-from <container> option) instead of declaring the volume
directly. Read more at https:/​ / ​ docs.​ docker.​ com/​ engine/​ tutorials/
dockervolumes/​ #creating-​ and-​ mounting-​ a-​ data-​ volume-​ container .


/\ Investigate this container for volumes thing.
