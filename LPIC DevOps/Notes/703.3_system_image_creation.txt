========== YOUR NOTES ==========

After a quick read on the packer documentation, most of their getting started doc is based on amazon and other paid & closed source cloud services, which are beyond the scope of this certification.


But there are useful things you can investigate:
- What are the most commonly used sections of a packer template file? What do builders, description, post-processors, provisioners and others do?
Answers are all here: https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/index.html

- How do you create vagrant and docker images?

https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/docker.html

I'd like to test the docker stuff. I wonder how different (possibly better than?) from regular Dockerfiles to build images the process is. Or maybe it isn't better, but just standardized across platforms?
