Ansile from beginner to pro page num:

NOTE: Trivago's laptop comes with UEFI enabled. Installing virtualbox requires fiddling with secure boot, something I'm not very keep to do on the company laptop! I'll guess I'll have to study this one on my desktop at home at a later time

There is no central server in ansible :o
By default, ansible will read /etc/ansible/hosts as its inventory file

You can pass a custom inventory file to ansible:
ansible all -i /path/to/inventory -m ping

Inventory files are either a ini or json file. Most of the times it's an ini file. They appear to contain a list of hosts which you want to target by ansible. (above, it runs the ping commant on the hosts in the intenvory file)

The contents of an inventory file in the ini format:

host1.example.com
host2.example.com
host3.example.com
192.168.9.29:2222

(Literally just a list of hosts. You can also specify a different ssh port as seen in the last entry)

Ansible also support ranges:

host[1:3].example.com


Common ansible inventory options (not a complete list!):
ansible_host - allows you to define the IP or FQDN of a given host.
Example entry: database01 ansible_host=192.168.50.10

ansible_user - The user you use to ssh into the machine to run the ansible entries
Example entry: 192.168.1.61 ansible_user=vagrant

ansible_port - The port used to connect to the SSH daemon on the remote machine. Only needed if you run SSH on non-standard ports.
Example entry: 192.168.1.61 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_port=2222

ansible_ssh_private_key_file - Path to a private key so you can login through SSH key based auth
Example entry: 192.168.100.10 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/daniel/.ssh/id_rsa

ansible_ssh_pass - If you don't use key based auth, this allows you to specify a password to login on the inventory file :laughing_emoji: Highly insecure, don't use this!
Example entry:  192.168.200.10 ansible_ssh_pass=supersecretpassword

ansible_ssh_extra_args
