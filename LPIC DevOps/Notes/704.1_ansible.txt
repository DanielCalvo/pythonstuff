Ansile from beginner to pro page num:

NOTE: Trivago's laptop comes with UEFI enabled. Installing virtualbox requires fiddling with secure boot, something I'm not very keep to do on the company laptop! I'll guess I'll have to study this one on my desktop at home at a later time


Ansible from beginner to pro page: 19

There is no central server in ansible :o
By default, ansible will read /etc/ansible/hosts as its inventory file

You can pass a custom inventory file to ansible:
ansible all -i /path/to/inventory -m ping

Inventory files are either a ini or json file. Most of the times it's an ini file. They appear to contain a list of hosts which you want to target by ansible. (above, it runs the ping commant on the hosts in the intenvory file)

The contents of an inventory file in the ini format:

host1.example.com
host2.example.com
host3.example.com
192.168.9.29:2222

(Literally just a list of hosts. You can also specify a different ssh port as seen in the last entry)

Ansible also support ranges:

host[1:3].example.com
