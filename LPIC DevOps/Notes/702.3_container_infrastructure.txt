702.3 Container Infrastructure (weight: 4)
Weight: 4

Description: Candidates should be able to set up a runtime environment for containers. This includes running containers on a local workstation as well as setting up a dedicated container host. Furthermore, candidates should be aware of other container infrastructures, storage, networking and container specific security aspects. This objective covers the feature set of Docker version 17.06 or later and Docker Machine 0.12 or later.

Key Knowledge Areas:

- Use Docker Machine to setup a Docker host <- 1 ----- DOCKER MACHINE -----
- Understand Docker networking concepts, including overlay networks
- Create and manage Docker networks
- Understand Docker storage concepts
- Create and manage Docker volumes
- Awareness of Flocker and flannel
- Understand the concepts of service discovery
- Basic feature knowledge of CoreOS Container Linux, rkt and etcd
- Understand security risks of container virtualization and container images and how to mitigate them

The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:
- docker-machine

Following up chapter 5 of Mastering Docker!
I'll only launch hosts on virtualbox for now.

docker-machine create --driver virtualbox docker-local
Runs a bunch of checks (such as checking that virtualbox is present), downloads boot2docker, creates a vm, sets up ssh keys, does a few docker things and bam, docker machine

docker-machine env docker-local
Lists environment variables for your docker-local docker machine. This will show you how to connect to the machine.

By running: eval $(docker-machine env docker-local)
You configure your docker client to connect to the docker server on the docker machine. This way you can interact with it as if it were a normal docker install on your local.

docker-machine ls
Shows you the available docker machines. The one with the asterisk is the active one!

You can also find a bunch of things about your docker-local machine:

docker-machine ip docker-local
docker-machine inspect docker-local
docker-machine config docker-local
docker-machine status docker-local
docker-machine url docker-local
