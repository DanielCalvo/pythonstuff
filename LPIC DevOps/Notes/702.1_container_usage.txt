702.1 Container Usage (weight: 7)
Weight: 7

Description: Candidates should be able to build, share and operate Docker containers. This includes creating Dockerfiles, using a Docker registry, creating and interacting with containers as well as connecting containers to networks and storage volumes. This objective covers the feature set of Docker version 17.06 or later.

Key Knowledge Areas:

- Understand the Docker architecture
- Use existing Docker images from a Docker registry
- Create Dockerfiles and build images from Dockerfiles
- Upload images to a Docker registry
- Operate and access Docker containers
- Connect container to Docker networks
- Use Docker volumes for shared and persistent container storage

The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:
- docker
- Dockerfile
- .dockerignore



Possible workflow:
- Create dockerfile
- Create image (docker image build --tag local:debiantest .)
- Launch container (docker container run -it--name debiantest1 local:debiantest /bin/bash)


docker build --tag local/apache-php:7 .
docker container run -d -p 8080:80 --name apache-php7 local/apache-php:7

docker image inspect local:debiantest #Neat!

docker pull vioseven/docker_automated #pull image from dockerhub (created on dockerhub)

Document docker per subcomands (image, container, swarm, volume and so on)
