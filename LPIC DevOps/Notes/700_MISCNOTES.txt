TODO IDEAS:
- Create container image through salt
- Set up macvlan networking
- Set up 3 instances: A web server with the logs on a volume, something to do queries to the webserver, and a logging container to do something with those logs on the volume
- Set up your own registry and describe how to do it!

Creating and testing your own symfony demo container:

mkdir symfonydemo
cd symfonydemo
vim Dockerfile

Put this in the Dockerfile as you know these are necessary:

FROM debian:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install curl php-symfony git -y
RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php && mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

To further investigate how to set up symfoiny demo, create an image from your Dockerfile and run bash into it so you can find out the next steps to have the image running:

#In the same directory as the Dockerfile:
docker image build . --tag symfonydemo:v1

#Launch image and run bash:
docker run -i -t symfonydemo:v1 /bin/bash

Remember to rebuild the image every time you change the Dockerfile!

When you're done with everything, how do you launch the instance again?

docker exec -it sad_hugle bash

docker exec --user root -it sad_hugle bash

docker run -d symfonydemo:v1
