### TODO Later
- Create a function that borrows a string and another one that takes ownership of the string to understand how this works properly later!
- Learn how to use a debugger! (GDB)

- Create a program that reads some string and prints it in uppercase
    - See how you handle type errors!

### Assorted notes
- `rustup doc` shows all the documentation that comes with rust! That's so cool! I can see why people like the language.
