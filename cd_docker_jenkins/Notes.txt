As the book wasn't interesting enough for a per-chapter note breakdown, I'm going to take a few general notes here:


CHAPTER 2: INTRODUCING DOCKER
Book goes over a few docker basics (what is docker?) and concepts (images, networks, volumes).
Most of this stuff can be better learned by reading Mastering Docker

CHAPTER 3: CONFIGURING JENKINS
Goes over a basic Jenkins install (either on a physical machine of docker container). Does Hello world type of stuff on Jenkins pipelines
The jenkins pipeline official doc is better for this.

INTERESTING: SLAVE TYPES
- Set up and describe the differences between slave types


CHAPTER 4: CONTINUOS INTEGRATION PIPELINE
Explains the idea of a pipeline and related concepts (Jenkinsfile, commit pipeline, tests, triggers, development workflows...)

CHAPTER 5: AUTOMATED ACCEPTANCE TESTING
Describes the creation of tests, setting up your docker registry and how to fit tests in your pipeline. Goes over docker-compose and a bunch of way you can launch containers to run tests. Talks about test workflows.
Lamp stack: Have a web, db, and test container on docker-compose.

CHAPTER 6: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT WITH ANSIBLE
Ansible ansible ansible.
Ansible is agentless.
Chapter goes over ansible playbooks, roles, ansible galaxy
Ansible Galaxy is nice, they have reusable content
Ansible Advantages: Agentless, supports both docker and non-docker hosts, ansible galaxy

CHAPTER 7: CONTINUOUS DELIVERY PIPELINE
Describes environments (prod, staging, qa  & dev)
Describe test types and which of them to run in each environment
Describes versioning strategies
Suggests releases through ansible playbooks

CHAPTER 8: CLUSTERING WITH DOCKER SWARM
Introduces Docker Swarm individually at first.
Covers running Jenkins slave nodes on a cluster (every jenkins job would run inside a jenkins slave container, spawned dynamically per job run)
Does not cover how to integrate this on a pipeline :o

CHAPTER 9:
Talks about database migrations. Introduces "Flyway" which is similar to Doctrine

INTERESTING: Describes parallel steps
INTERESTING: Reusing pipeline components. Suggests creating a single Jenkinsfile with parameters to different environments
INTERESTING: Talks about shared libraries. Perhaps these should be approached with caution to avoid creating black boxes
INTERESTING: Blue Green deployment
INTERESTING: Automating build deployment
VERY INTERESTING: Best practices


Resumen: Book is good if we want to suggest how testing should be done (which is a subject that we can approach in the future?)

Does not cover what I wanted in good detail (how to launch the infra for the pipeline inside docker swarm)
