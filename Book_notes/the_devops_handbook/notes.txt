1: Agile, Continous Delivery and the Three ways

The manufacturing value stream: The sequence of activities an organization undertakes to deliver upon a customer request.

There's also the "Technology value stream", but we can call it just value stream.

Lead time: Time from ticket created to thing deployed.
Lead time needs to be short.
Work in small batches.
Desired: Deployment lead time of minutes. Deploy small things incrementally.

Goal: Have testing and operations happening simultaneously with design/development, enabling fast flow and high quality. This method works when we work in small batches.

Commit small code changes to version control, perform testing against it, deploy it to production.

Commit -> Automated test -> Exploratory test -> Production deploy
            10m                 10m                 5m
