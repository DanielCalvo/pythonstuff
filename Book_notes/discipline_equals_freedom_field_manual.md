## Part one: Thoughts

### Where does discipline come from? 
- Discipline comes from within. Discipline is an internal Force. Make the decision. Make the commitment. 

### The person you can control
- The only person you can control is yourself.

### Mind control
- You have control over your mind. You just have to assert it.

### Weakness
- Don't accept your weakness. Fight. Be always fighting. 

### Stress
- Gain perspective. Warriors have faced much worse. Gain control of what you can control. If the stress is something you can't control, embrace it. Figure out a way to take advantage.

### Destroyer mode
- It takes both emotion and logic to reach your maximum potential. When one fails, you need to rely on the other. When it doesn't make any logical sense to go on that's when your user in motion comes your anger, your frustration, your fear, to push you further. When you're feelings are screaming that you have had enough. When you think you are going to break emotionally, override that emotion with concrete logic and willpower that says one thing: I don't stop.

### Until the end
- It never finishes. You always have more to do. The enemy is always watching. Be relentless.

### Application of discipline
- Discipline starts with waking up early. Discipline is about facing your fears so you can conquer them. Discipline means taking the hard Road. Discipline is your best friend... 

### Questions
Question everything. Learn until you understand question yourself. It will lead to truth. 

### Fight
- Fight weakness and fight fear. Give everyday everything you got.

### Compromise
- When working with others, you must compromise
- There are areas within yourself you cannot compromise. Work hard, train hard, improve yourself, do not rest on your laurels, face your demons, do not give up, give out or give in. Stand and maintain your self discipline

### Default aggressive
- Agression: The unstoppable fighting spirit. The drive. The desire to achieve success. The will to win.

### Nature vs Nurture
- The people who are successful decide they are going to be successful.
- They decide to study hard, work hard and put in the time.
- They will lead when no one else will.
- They choose to become who they want to become.

### Fear of failure
- Fear of failure is positive. It'll keep you training hard
- However: Be terrified of sitting in the sidelines doing nothing. The true horror is being stagnant.
- Take the risk, the gamble, the action: Don't let another day slip by.

### The warpath
- Be at war against weakness, ignorance and confusion. It will lead to strenght, knowledge and understanding
- The warpath is the interminable path of discipline that leads to freedom.

### Sugarcoated lies
- Donuts aren't food. They're poison.

### Bad instincts
- When adversity manifests itself, it is not ok to give in. Do not take the easy way out.
- Maybe you have to retreat, but take that decision based on logic.
- Get up, go, and fight on

### Not feeling it
- Go anyway. Get it done. If you're just going through the motions, go through the motions.
- If you feel like you need a rest, wait until tomorrow. If you still need it then, take it.

### Regret
- We have so much to learn
- The only thing valuable in regret is the lesson learned, other than that, it is worthless. Don't let it beat you down

### Focus
- Do not let your long term goals slip from your vision
- The little tasks and projects you tackle need to lead toward your long term goals
- Embed your long term goals in your mind. Burn them in your soul. Don't lose vision. Talk about it, write about it, hang it up on your wall
- Do something about them. Every day. Do something that moves you closer to them. However small or insignificant, do it. 

### Hesitation
- Hesitation is the enemy. It allows the moment to pass, the opportunity to be lost, the enemy to get the upper hand. It turns into cowardice
- Do not hesitate, go forward and win

### Draw fire
- Sometimes bad things happen
- Face this issue with courage and resolution.
- Lead. Be the one who people look to. When bad things are happening, I will be the one good thing standing tall that can be relied upon.
- The ultimate victory is to hold your head high, and even in the face of inescapable defeat, to stand and fight

### GOOD
- Mission got canceled? Good, we can focus on the other one
- Didn't get the new gear we wanted? Good, we can keep it simple
- Didn't get promoted? Good, more time to get better
- Didn't get the job you wanted? Good, more time to gain more experience and build a better resume.
- Got injured? Good, needed a break from training
- Got beat? Good, you learned.
- Unexpected problems? Good. You can figure out a solution
- A positive attitude won't solve all problems, but neither will dwelling on the problems. Accept reality, but focus on the solution.
- Take the problem and turn it into something good. Move forward.
- If you're part of a team, that attitude will spread.

### Death
- Be grateful for all your days, and be grateful to have met those who are no longer with you.
- Live every day with purpose and passion for those who don't have that opportunity, for those who were stolen away by death's cruel hand.

### Every day
- This isn't a part time gig
- This is an everyday gig: Every day is Monday
- Every day is a new beginning

### No more
- No more excuses
- No more "I'll start tomorrow" or "Just this once"
- Through strenght, will and discipline, become you you want to be, become what you want to be
- Only after that can you rest and say "no more"

### Staying motivated
- Don't worry about motivation
- Don't count on motivation
- Count on discipline
- You know what you have to do, so make yourself do it

### Me versus me
- It is improbable that you can be the best in the world at something, but you can be the best you can be
- The glory of that journey happens in solitude
- That victory is earned every single day, being better today than you were yesterday

### Remain vigilant
- We are not defeated at once, we are taken apart slowly.
- Convinced to take an easier part, enticed by comfort.
- A slow incremental process chips away at discipline and what you should be
- Be vigilant, be on guard and hold the line on the seemingly insignificant little things. Things that shouldn't matter, but they do

### Fear
- Fear is normal. Everybody feels fear at some point.
- Step agressively toward your fear, that's bravery.
- We are scared of what we don't know, and there's one way to confront that fear: Go.
- How do you get to the gym? How do you change your diet? How do you overcome the fear of failure? How do you face the unknown? Go.
- Don't plan anymore, or contemplate, or think, or wait, or make excuses or justifications. Take action. Now.
- The first step that you need to take is just that. A step. Go.

### The darkness
- There are times when the nights will be long and dark and you will be alone. There will be times when the darkness will seem to consume everything.
- Don't let it consume you
- Even in the darkest times, the darkness cannot extinguish your light, your will, and your determination
- No matter what is happening and how hard the fight is, as long as you keep fighting, you win
- Only surrender is defeat. Only quitting is the end. The darkness only wins if you let it. Do not let the darkness win.
- To fight against the darkness is to win.

### Overwhelmed
- Life can be overwhelming
- Assess what those problems are, decide which one you are going to attack first, and get started
- It won't be easy. It will be hard. Life's hard, that's what it is.
- Do not let these problems take you down. Confront these problems, face them, fight them.
- Let these problems raise you up. Let them demands and trials make you stronger. The adversity you face today will turn you into a better person tomorrow.
- In the end you'll be able to look at thse problems and say: Thank you. You made me better.

### Negative talk from negative people
- Ignore and outperform
- Win

### Hold the line
- Live in defiance of the weakness and in rebellion against decay

### Begin
- When the alarm sounds, it is time. Rise, despite fatigue and soreness.
- Curse the warmth of the bed. Curse the comfort of the pillow. Fight the temptation of weakness.
- Get up and go, quickly without thought. Do not reason with weakness. You must take action. Get up and go.

### Laughter wins
- Don't live in darkness. Have fun, laugh, joke.
- Life's tough, but it gets a lot easier when you're laughing at it.
- To spite the suffering and the hardships, laught at them all.
- Laughter wins
