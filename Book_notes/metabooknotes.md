### The managers path
- Has a few chapters you skimmed (07 and 08) with some bits of useful info. Could be fun to re-read and write a summary down
- Otherwise how useful this book is depends on how involved with management you get in the future
- The information on the book is still good to understand how teams operate though

### Discipline equals freedom: Field manual
- The first "Thoughts" section has notes on it's entirety
- The last part was skimmed as it's about things I'm not involved with (ex: martial arts and firearms) and the workouts are very situation dependent
- Could be fun to revisit at some point for completion points

### The DevOps handbook
- Took very detailed notes on the first 3 chapters
- Rest of the book seemed very broad, and the knowledge difficult to distill into actionable things
- Might be interesting to revisit at some point too
