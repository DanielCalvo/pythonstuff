Dani says: Good book, but it is particularly useful if you're a manager. I'm not a manager, so it's only partially useful, and it was approached with in a "best effort" case scenario during a single day.

### 07, 08.
- Just skimmed over quickly

### 09: Bootstrapping Culture
- Focuses on culture, a bit off topic for now. Later parts of the chapter talks about code reviews, interesting
