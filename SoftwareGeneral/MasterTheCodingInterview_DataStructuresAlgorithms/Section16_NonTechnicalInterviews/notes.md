### 217. During the interview
- This is not your only chance. Don't be nervous!

- The interviewer wants to answer 3 questions
    - Can you do the job?
    - Can I work with you?
    - Are you going to improve?

#### Keep in mind the 4 heroes
- Technical: Have a story prepared, talk about some technical project that can impress the interviewer
- Success: This hero story shows that you're a successful person. If you built something, what did you do?
- Leadership: Are you the type of person that takes charge and doesn't get told what to do all the time, and can be left on their own?
- Challenge: They wanna hear a story of you going through some really challenging circumstance
    - When left alone, you can overcome any challenge

### 218. Exercise: Hero Stories

- Answer in about a minute!
- Tell your hero's journey
    - In a way that is relevant to the current job
- This lecture is really good. Re-watch it to get your answer right. The way the guy does the hero journey is pretty cool

### 222. Tell me about a problem you have solved

    - Result: What happened after you took that action?

### 228. Secret weapon
- Simplicity over complexity. Demonstrate that you're the type of person that focuses on simplicity when possible
- Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Make the interviewer understand that you value the value of time and resources and money
- You focus on overall goals, and are not myopic. Myopic: Very narrowly focused on one thing. You understand about the overall goal of the thing you're writing
- No complaining about client/code/etc
- No ego. We work as a team there's no individual, the overall goal of the company or the project is what matters

### 229. After the Interview

- Don't brag
- Example: Say you work hard, play well nicely with others, isn't too narrowminded, say you don't have to be micromanaged, etc
