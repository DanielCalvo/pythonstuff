### 231. Section overview

### 232. Handling Rejection
- Rejections are not a predictor of success. Dust yourself off and keep swinging
- Try to extract as much information as possible from the company
- Ask when it would be okay to re-apply if you're still interested down the road

### 233. Negotiation 101
- If asked "what salary do you want", what do you say?
- Possible answer: "I know that the average software developer in silicon valley makes about 120k a year, so that's a good place to start"
    - Don't end the conversation
- Give reason for everything
- Always negotiate
- Be positive. Negotiation doesn't mean being mean
- When negotiating, have stakes. Stakes means you have to have something on the line.
    - If they know you're desperate and you have no other options, they know you
    - The best thing for negotiating is having other options. Recruiters are always open to negotiating if they want you

### 234. Handling an Offer
- Remember: Don't end the conversation
- Say something like "This sounds fantastic I'm glad for the interview andI had the feeling this was a good match etd"
- Right now I'm talking to a few other companies, say that things are in process elsewhere.
    - Remember to be positive! You don't want to seem greedy
- Ideally, when you receive an offer, ask for more time. Especially if this is your first offer. Time is the most valuable thing you can ask for
- After you receive the offer, let other companies know

- TODO:
    - Find exactly salary you want
    - Do your research on the avg industry pay. You want to get paid average or above
    - What value do you provide? What would you improve in the company? What type of traits make you a valuable hire?
    - You can mention how you would provide value and how you deserve perhaps a higher salary
    - Always go higher than their initial demands, and you wanna meet somewhere in the middle

### 235. Handling Multiple Offers
