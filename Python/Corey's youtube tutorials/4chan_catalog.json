I would like to spend more or less 10k\u20ac but if the car feels right I can push to 20k. Mandatory rear or 4wd. Better if with a manual transmission. I do 15000-20000 km normally in the year so it&#039;s not necessary to worry too much for small dispacements. I&#039;m ok with two seaters. At the moment I&#039;ve found a bunch of BMW 6 series (e63). Having compared them the 635d twinturbo seems the best choice. The 630 petrol is ok too, I won&#039;t ever track my car so I don&#039;t care for the fastest-car-in-da-street meme.<br>Does anyone in /o/ have experience with the 6 series? Any proposal of a good looking used car for that price range?",

I guess, as I am not aware of them having a trackbar in their suspension config. Only thing that was better in suspension in later models were longer toe control linkages were too short causing toe in/out under suspension unload in the back (braking, lift off and such) causing to lose grip and snap your cock. Later models had them lenghtened and problem was vastly tackled. Basically rear suspension tune up and put a wider tyres there and you got your snaps covered.",

Kia may be a subsidiary, but they make better vehicles. Alternatively, for something inexpensive and reliable, buy Japanese. They hold up better than the Korean and American cars, cost less and have lower costs of maintenance than anything out of Europe.

I just bought it, and it set me back less than $5000... let me explain how much car that is for the money. <br>It&#039;s got a big v8 and it&#039;s fast. (0-60 in 5.7), handles much better than you&#039;d expect, especially in sport mode. The steering is HEAVY and feels just so nice after driving cars with light steering for years. And as a Mercedes that originally stickered for big money, it&#039;s... luxurious. The brand new air suspension can be pretty stiff in sport mode, but while in comfort it delivers fluffy cloud ride quality. And then there&#039;s the interior. Simply draped in leather and wood with a level of fit and finish that is nothing short of remarkable. the sound system is glorious, producing bass that shakes the car and levels of volume that will easily deafen you. <br>to everyone about to comment &quot;a cheap Mercedes is the most expensive car you can buy&quot; , I&#039;m not as dumb as you think: this car is not like most cheap Mercs.<br>I picked it up from a wealthy business man who had meticulously maintained it for 15 years, and had driven it just 92,000 miles after he bought it new. He also did me a huge service by replacing all four corners of the air suspension which is what always goes wrong with these cars and costs huge money.<br>Overall, If I tried to explain just how much I love my 500 black Benz to a non car enthusiast, he or she would think I was a ridiculous person, but I have a feeling you all will understand :)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TL;DR can we all agree this was a solid purchase?</span>",

You can then gear it for both low and high RPM, or low and high boost levels depending on octane availability. Rotrex is working on CVT units, too. If you know how a Prius drivetrain works, kinda like that. They use a pulley and a 12V (or 48V) input to basically keep the supercharger at high RPM, no matter the engine RPM.

I&#039;d love to hear your guys&#039; experience on your first new car.<br><br>Parents gave me their old 06 civic lx in 2010. Been scrounging for awhile and I&#039;ve narrowed it down to two options.<br><br>A new civic lx-p 2018 or a used 44k mile 2015 Accord with v6. <br><br>I&#039;ve heard terms about breaking a car in but is it worth it to get that v6 Accord? The cost is almost the same as a brand new lx-p civic. <br><br>I appreciate the insight!",

I have zero auto knowledge and I know you aren&#039;t my personal army but I&#039;m desperate enough to at least try. <br><br>So, pic related is my current vehicle, it shakes and acts crazy when trying to accelerate and idles strange at times. even at highway speeds it lurches a little and i think it does that when it&#039;s shifting gears but i have no idea. Also it doesnt always do that. Plus my girlfriend&#039;s dad took this cover thing off the fuel injectors(?) near the coil, he suspects its the coil, but since then the symptoms persist but arent as bad. i can take a picture of the removed part if anyone ends up caring. im gonna try replacing the fuel filter ASAP i have to work today or id do it immediately. ive typed too much already so if you need more details please ask. <br><br>would love some help but i dont expect it. have a good one boys",
