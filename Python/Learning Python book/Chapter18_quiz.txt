5. What gets printed by this, and why?

def func(a, b, c=3, d=4): print(a, b, c, d)

func(1, *(5, 6))

Answer: 1,(5,6),3,4
Wrong! Actual answer: 1 5 6 4



def func(a, b, c): a = 2; b[0] = 'x'; c['a'] = 'y'

l=1; m=[1]; n={'a':0}
func(l, m, n)
print(l, m, n)

Amswer:
Partially wrong. Right answer: 1,['x'],{'a':'y'}
