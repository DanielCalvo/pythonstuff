1. Name three ways that you can assign three variables to the same value.

One:
a = 0
b = 0
c = 0

Two:
a = b = c = 0

Three:
a, b, c = 0, 0, 0

2. Why might you need to care when assigning three variables to a mutable object?

Internally, python might treat these 3 variables as a reference to the same object. Thus, changing the value of one variable could change the value of the other two.

3. Whatâ€™s wrong with saying L = L.sort()?

What is probably intended here is to assign the sorted array back to L.

Instead, L will receive the return value of the L.sort execution ('None', in this case) which is not the sorted array itself.

L.sort() will sort the array in place, you don't need to do any assignment back to the L variable.

4. How might you use the print operation to send text to an external file?

Using the file argument on the print function

print("message!", file=myfile)
