Under this folder there is a program created to partially automate magic spell creating (runes) on a MMORPG named Tibia. It reads certain elements from the game UI and performs basic actions.
If you stumble upon this script on the Internet, please note that is against Tibia rules as stated here: https://www.tibia.com/support/?subtopic=tibiarules&rule=3b

The script is named "test.py" on a directory named test as to avoid detection by anti-cheat systems. BattlEye (anti-cheat) monitors processes running on your machine, and having a process named "guiautomation/runemaker.py" would be too much of a giveaway.

I remember doing this task manually when I was a kid in 2003 on dial up Internet. I have fond memories of that time.
Automating this was on my bucket list and now 16 years later I've done it. Time flies. Have fun, cherish life and stay hungry.
