1. How might you code a multiway branch in Python?

If with elif statements!
The compact stuff can be difficult to read, I'd rather skip it

2. How can you code an if/else statement as an expression in Python?

X = Z if X else B

3. How can you make a single statement spam many lines?

Some statements such as declaring lists or printing things can be simply be typed over multiple lines:

print('hello'
      'world')

You can also use a reverse bar, though it is discouraged

A = 1 + 2 \
    + 3

4. What do the words True and False mean?

True and False are just aliases for 1 and 0.
