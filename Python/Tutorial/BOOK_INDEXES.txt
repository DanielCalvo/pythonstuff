Learning Python 5ed: 467


Ideas:
Doing it by python, grants all rights to tables on a database except one table

Write a function or object (object with a write method!) or something that writes stuff to multiple files and/or over the network!

Things you glossed over:
- Zip in loop coding techniques, page 407


--- NOTES ---
Page 436: I still don't understand the map function very well. Zip also confuses me a bit.

Review the early chapters (especially the ones on lists and dictionaries). I feel I could benefit from reviewing them with a better understanding of the language.

Chapter 14 left me rather confused.

Chapter 15: The documentation that ships with python may prove itself useful. Perhaps skimming it could teach you new things.
