Learning Python 5ed: 523

Ideas:
Doing it by python, grants all rights to tables on a database except one table

Write a function or object (object with a write method!) or something that writes stuff to multiple files and/or over the network!

Things you glossed over:
- Zip in loop coding techniques, page 407


--- NOTES ---
Page 407: Zip in loops remained gloosed over
Page 436: I still don't understand the map function very well. Zip also confuses me a bit.
Chapter 15: The documentation that ships with python may prove itself useful. Perhaps skimming it could teach you new things.
Page 468: The fourth exercise remains to be done at some other time
Page 501: Is the concept of a function factory useful in Python?
Page 507: Avoided nested functions as it may be too elaborate for any real world use scenario (I hope to not be wrong...)
Page 518: Left that somewhat complicated custom open function to be seen at a later chapter...

Review the early chapters (especially the ones on lists and dictionaries). I feel I could benefit from reviewing them with a better understanding of the language.
