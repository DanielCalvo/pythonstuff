1. What is the point of coding functions?

To be able to reuse code! This way you don't have to type and modify the same thing over and over multiple times across a program.

2. At what time does Python create a function?

When it goes through the def statement

3. What does a function return if it has no return statement in it?

It returns None.

4. When does the code nested inside the function definition statement run?

When the function is called (not defined!)

5. Whatâ€™s wrong with checking the types of objects passed into a function?

Python supports polymorphism! A given function can work with multiple object types. If incompatible objects are passed to a function, it'll raise an exception anyway.
