17.260 How to wire up cert manager
#We'll create two objects:
#Certificate: (config file) Object describing details about the certificate that should be obtained
#Issuer: (config file) Object telling the cert manager where to get the certificate from
#Cert Manager: Created by Helm
#We'll also need to reconfigure our nginx ingress :o

#17.263
#Put certificate.yaml and issuer.yaml together
#Did a git push
#Once you push you should see the changes apply as per the deploy on travis-ci

#17.264 Verifying the certificate
kubectl get certificates
kubectl describe certificates
#Check the secret to see if the certificate is there
kubectl get secrets

#17.226
#It worked!
