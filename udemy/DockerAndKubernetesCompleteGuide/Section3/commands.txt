#3.27 Creating docker images
#Creating a dockerfile:
# - Specify a base image
# - Run some commands to install additional programs
# - Specify a command to run on container startup

#3.28 Building a Dockerfile
#Create the dockerfile as described on the video and:

cd Section3/redis-image
docker build .
docker run 936f0b884b18

#3.29 Dockerfile teardown
FROM alpine
RUN apk add --update redis
CMD ["redis-server"]

#3.30 What's a base image?
#An operating system that is useful for you!

#3.31 The build process in detail
#The build command is what is used to take a Dockerfile and generate an image out of it
#Docker creates intermediate containers for every step of the build process.
#A snapshot of the filesystem of the intermediate container is then passed on to the next build step as an image
#The next build steps creates an intermediate container from this image, runs a command, modifies the image, and then passes it to the next step until the build process is complete.
#Cool chapter!
#3.32 A brief recap
#Autho re-iterates that every step on the Dockerfile is done through a temporary container, and each steps of the Dockerfile iterates over a snapshot of the filesystem that each step on the Dockerfile modifies.

#3.33 Rebuilds with cache
#Docker caches the images from build steps, in order make the build process faster
#If a line on the Dockerfile is modified, from that point onwards the cache will no longer be used (from the changed line on down)

#3.34 #Building an image
docker build .
docker run 9097dd0aec3e
docker build -t vioseven/redis:latest .
#Above: <your docker id>/<project name>:<version>
docker run vioseven/redis

#3.35 Manual image generation with Docker commit
docker run -it alpine sh
docker ps
docker commit -c 'CMD ["redis-server"]' aa3a5898a13e
#sha256:6dd0a132a4c7d603ce9e193842ab49fd52a23e740c0f2a91cf18f2fca43e5d38
docker run 6dd0
#Usually shouldn't use docker commit to modify images. Use Dockerfiles instead
