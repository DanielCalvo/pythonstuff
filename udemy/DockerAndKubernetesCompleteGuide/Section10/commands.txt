#10.126 Production multi container deployment

#The flow is:
#Push Github
#Send hook to Travis, Travis pulls
#Travis builds a test image and runs tests
#If tests pass, Travis builds a prod image
#Travis pushes built prod images to Dockerhub
#Travis pushes project to AWS EBS (?, probably just sends a webhook)
#EBS pulls images from dockerhub, deploys (?)

#Question marks indicate sections that I'm not sure why they're there or how they work. I guess we'll find out!

#10.127 Production Dockefiles
#Just copied and pasted Dockerfiles around

#10.128 Multiple nginx instances
#The nginx we had in Section9 was just responsble for routing! (certain parts of the app go to certain containers, getting to the correct backend)
#This time we're gonna have 2 nginx servers. One to do the app routing and another one to serve the react files. See diagram on lecture.

#10.129 Altering Nginx's listen port
#Created a default.conf for nginx on the client folder
#Wrote a production dockerfile for the client folder which is very similar to the docker-react project used in previous chapters. This one listens on port 3000 though, and has a different nginx default.conf file.

#10.130 A quick fix
#Added a line on nginx's default.conf to fix a bug from the instructor :o

#10.131 Cleaning up tests
#Edited App.test.js and removed everything to make a test that passes 100% of the time, ha!

#10.132 Github and travis setup

#10.133
#10.134
#10.135
