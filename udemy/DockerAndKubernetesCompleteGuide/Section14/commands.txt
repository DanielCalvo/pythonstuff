#14.183 The path to production
#Frick yeah moving to production!

#14.184 Checkpoint files
#All good!

#14.185 A quick checkpoint
#Deleted a bunch of stuff

#14.186
#Created the client-deployment.yaml

#14.187 NodePort vs ClusterIP Services
#ClusterIP: Exposes a set of pods to other objects in the cluster. A ClusterIP does not allow traffic from the outside world to come in!
#NodePort: Exposes a set of pods to the outside world (only for dev!)
#We're going to use the Ingress service to let traffic come in to inside the cluster.

#14.188 The ClusterIP config
#Wrote it down. Getting the hang of it!

#14.189 Applying multiple files with kubectl
#Delete old deployment:
kubectl delete deployment client-deployment

kubectl get services
#Delete the client-node-port if it's still there too

kubectl apply -f k8s #Applies all the config files in the directory

kubect get pods
kubectl get services
