Author recommends books: Go in action, The go Programming Language, golang-book.com, go by example
golang.org/ref/spec is written in a manner that can be difficult to understand at first
Effective go is easier to get into: https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html

You can tell the future by looking very closely at the seeds you plant today!
If you have grit and persistence and work every day, you'll get there!


12:
mkdir mygoworkspace
cd mygoworkspace
mkdir bin pkg src


13:
GOROOT and GOPATH are the most important variables for Go


15:
go version
go env
go help
go help fmt 
go fmt $SOURCEFILE #Will properly format a source file (ident, new lines, etc)
go run main.go
go install main.go (moves executable to GOBIN?)
go get $REPO_URL


19:
Every program needs a package main and a func main


20: Packages
Packages: Code that is already written that you can use. Import imports that package
func Println(a .... interface{}) <- Takes any number of arguments
The "... sometime" is how we signify a variatic parameter
the type "interface{}" is the empty interface
every value is also of type "interface{}" (wut?)
The underscore charater (_) throws aways returns
You can't have unused variables in your code


21:
:= is the short declaration operator. It declares a variable and assigns a value to it


22:
The difference between using the short declaration operator and the var keyword is that you can use the var keyword to declare a variable outside a function body
var allows you declare a variable outside a function body
Best practice: Limit the scope of your variable and try to use the short declaration variable
When a variable is initialized but no value is given, the variable is given a default value
The variable is set to the zero value of it's type: https://golang.org/ref/spec#The_zero_value


23:
Go is all about type!
A variable of a certain type can only hold values of that type


27:
In Go you convert types, you don't cast them.
Even if you don't believe, keep doing it!


36:
integers do not have decimals
floats do have decimals


92:
A struct is an agregate data type. It agregates together values of different types.

93:
When embedding structs, the inner type gets promoted to the outer type


96:
Aliasing a type is usually not a good idea unless you want to add methods to it
Todd recommends: Always use the field name. It's clearer!
