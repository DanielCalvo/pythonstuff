O program that suffles cards, uh-oh!

Go is statically typed!
Python is dynamically typed

Basic types available: bool, string, int, float64

":=" is only used when definining a variable the first time!


16. Slices and for loops
Array = Fixed lenght list of things
Slice = An array that can grow or shrink


17:
Go is not object oriented :o
We're going to take a type (such as an array) and we're going to extend it's functionality


19:
func (d deck) print() {
d: The actual copy of the deck we're working on is available in this function as a variable called 'd'
deck: Every variable called deck can call this function on itself
}


23:
Any time you see a square bracket, you wanna be thinking of a slice
