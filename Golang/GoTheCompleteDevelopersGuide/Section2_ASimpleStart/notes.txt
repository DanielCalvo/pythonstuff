7. Five important questions

How do we run the code in our project?
go run main.go

But wait, there's more:

go build: Compiles go source code
go run: Compiles and executes code
go fmt: Formats all the code in each file in the current directory
go install: Compiles and installs a package
go get: Downloads the source code of someone else's package
go test: Runs any tests associated with the current project


8. Go packages
What does 'package main' mean?
Package == Project == Workspace
A package is a collection of common source files.
Every first line of a file must declare the package that it belongs to.

There are two different types of packages in Go: Executable and Reusable.
Executable: Generates a file that we can run.
Reusable: Code used as 'helpers'. Where you put the reusable logic. Code dependencies or libraries.
It's the name of the package that you use that determines of you're making a executable or reusable type package.
"main" is used to make an executable package. If we had named the package something else, we wouldn't have gotten an executable.
Package main must have a func called main.


9. Import statements
The import package gives our package access to some code that is written inside another package.
The fmt library is used to print out stuff.

10. File organization
func is short for function
Files in go always follow a patten: package, import, func
