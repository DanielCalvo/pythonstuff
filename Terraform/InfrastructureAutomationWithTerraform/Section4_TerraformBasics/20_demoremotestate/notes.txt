When you execuute terraform apply, a new terraform.tfstate and a new terraform.tfstate.backup is written.
This is how terraform keeps track of the remote state.

You can keep terraform.tfstate in version control, this allows you to see a history of your infrastructure. It allows you to colaborate with other team members.

You can configure a "backend" to store the terraform state remotely (such as in amazon s3)

The default backedn is the local backend, the one we've been using until now. It saves the file on the local filesystem.

There are 2 steps to configure a remote state:
- Add the backend code to a .tf file
- Run the initialization process.

You can't use variables on the terraform backend definition, so:
- Manually login on AWS and create a S3 bucket
- On your local, run aws configure
