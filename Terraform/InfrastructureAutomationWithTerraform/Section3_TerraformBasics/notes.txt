9. First steps with terraform - AWS setup
Create a user an user (or go to an existing one on the IAM tab and make sure to get your current, or create new ones, access key ID and Secret Access Key.

Attach an AdministratorAccess policy to this user!


10. Spinning up an instance
Ended up using this to build an instance: https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/build
Don't forget to do `aws configure` first of all!
Then:
terraform init
terraform apply
terraform destroy
terraform plan
terraform plan -out out.terraform


11. Basic recap:
Logged in on AWS, created an IAM admin user
Installed aws cli locally and configured it with that user
Installed terraform locally
Did terraform init, created a basic file to spin up a t2.micro instance, destroyed everything
