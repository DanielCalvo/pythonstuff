- Read the docs for each chapter on top of Stephane's explanations
    - Make sure to find the docs for each service described by Stephane and go through them carefully 
- It would be neat for you to come up with architectures (theoretical ones) and implement them yourself! Especially the serverless ones

### Section 4
- Do an ASG with LB by hand to see if you got most of it in your head
