- Maybe create one markdown named "services, abridged" with one service per line describing them (see the last lecture of chapter 14)
- Perhaps check other material after finishing the course
- Create questions and answers, just like with the LPIC maybe?

- Make a summary and abbreviations page, there are too many abbreviations!

- Hey how about you do the network setup on the network lecture on terraform/cloudformation?
