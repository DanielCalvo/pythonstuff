- Aaaa you missed lecture 28 on "what is consistent hashing useful for"

### For later
- Make a list of Istio features so you don't forget about the things that are possible, even if you don't implement them
- https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/

- Implement most things on this course on your own with your own yaml so you really learn what happened here
- What are the Istio objects you can use with kubectl again?https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/
- Can istio be used to limit outgoing bandwitdh for a given deployment?
	- I'm thinking about making mdscanner intentianlly slow just to see if it breaks!

- Remember to list all the features istio has, the ones you've seen on this couse but as well other ones listed on the documentation, so when you do your pet project you can pick which ones to choose.
- Having an overview of all the features is a really nice thing to have too! Knowldge of all the things you can do is POWAH
- Oh damn, multicluster istio meshes are a thing? That looks like an interesting thing to investigate!
	- Can you research k8s multicluster administration as a topic? Is there aything useful tere?
- The istio yamls have a very nice example of using the HPA and limits!
- For later on Istio: Explore the grafana dashboards!
- Try not to make guesses with requests: Look at grafana to see how much CPU and memory your pods are using
