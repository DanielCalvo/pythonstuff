#5.47 App overview
#Multiple node apps connecting to a redis instance. Neat!
#But it looks like we're going for a simple approach now

#5.48 and 5.49 were about Javascript

#5.50 Assembling a Dockerfile
#Put the Dockerfile together
#docker build .
#docker build -t vioseven/visits:latest .

#5.51 Introducing Docker compose
docker run vioseven/visits
#No redis! :(
docker run redis
#To set up network connections between two containers, there are two options:
#Use the docker CLI's network features
#Use docker compose
#Docker compose is a much better alternative!

#Docker compose is:
#A separate command that comes installed with Docker
#Used to start up multiple containers at the same time
#Automates many of the long arguments we were passing to docker previously
#The pupose of docker compose is to function as docker cli, but allow you issue multiple commands much quicker!

#5.52 Docker Compose Files
#Just built the docker compose on this one

#5.53 Networking with Docker compose
#By the defining two services inside a docker compose file, docker will create the two Â¡services on the same network
#By creating a service, docker makes the name of that service available for containers inside the docker compose

#5.54 Docker compose commands
#To launch everything: docker-compose up --build
#docker run myimage == docker-compose up
#docker build . && docker run myimage == docker-compose up --build

#5.55 Docker compose containers
docker run -d redis
docker ps
docker stop 245b4a515de9
#To start a group of containers:
docker-compose up -d
#To stop:
docker-compose down

#5.56
#Theoretical chapter showing that once a container crashes, it does not automatically come back up
#You can specify several 'restart' conditions in docker-compose.yml to make a container restart

#5.57 Container status with docker compose
docker-compose up
docker-compose ps
#The docker-compose ps command is meant to run in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml file is located
#As a matter of fact, most docker-compose commands need to be run from the appropriate directory
