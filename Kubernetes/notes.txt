Just read the whole thing: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service#services_of_type_clusterip
- Detail your CI process and see how you would go about reproducing it
- Do you get a dump in your database once it's running or do you have a db image with the dump inside of it already?


The tutorials on google cloud seem really good!

- You still need to deploy Kubernetes locally to learn about etcd and networking things

Challenges for you to figure out for now:
- How to automatically set up DNS entries once a service goes up
- How to deploy a python script that will connect to Redis and MySQL, with persistent data
