There are new 'kinds' you need to learn:
- ServiceAccount
- ClusterRole
- ClusterRoleBinding
- StatefulSet
- StorageClass

You stopped on the fluentd part of video 1.2

There seems to be a pattern that for a given service, you get a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole and a ClusterRoleBinding structure set up.

Maybe to the other course from this guy, perhaps he uses AWS/Kops to set all of this up

(I think you saw these on StephenGrider's course but he created them imperatively)

Also create some persistent volumes on your own (and create and delete a deployment to use them, and see if the files persist in the cluster)
Can you also provision your google stuff to use any other filesystem in the cloud as a volume, such as the S3 equivalent of Amazon?

Also, make your Google cloud Kubernetes instances connect to Google's SQL technology

And also, spawn everything Kubernetes in AWS!
