4. Logging in Kubernetes

When you have a single app, it's very easy to see what's going on.
You just open the "app.log" file and take a look.
Or use kubectl logs

If you have many pods, it isn't that easy.

There are some commercial options, but let's use a variation of the ELK stack!
We'll use:

- Fluentd
- ElasticSearch
- Kibana
- LogTrail
