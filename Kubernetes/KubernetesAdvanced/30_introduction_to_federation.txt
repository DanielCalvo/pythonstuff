Federation:

- Federation can be used to manage multiple clusters
- You can sync resources across clusters
- The same deployment version can run on clusters A and B
- You can do cross cluster discovery
- You can have one virtual IP for a resource spawning multiple clusters
- This can help to achieve high availability / fault isolation (regions on cloud services can fail)
- Scale beyond the limitations of one cluster
- Run clusters in a hybrid cloud environment (a cluster can be on premises with a failover to the cloud! :o)

You can use a tool named Kubefed to administer your federated clusters.
