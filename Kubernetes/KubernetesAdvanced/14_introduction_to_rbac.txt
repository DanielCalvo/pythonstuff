Intro to RBAC:

You can add RBAC resources with kubectl to grant permissions.
You describe them in yaml format, then apply them to the cluster

First you define a role, then you assign users/groups to that role.

You can create roles limited to a single namespace or you can create roles that apply to all namespaces

Role: Single namespace
ClusterRole: cluster-wide
RoleBinding: Single namespace
ClusterRoleBinding: cluster-wide
