Author through kubectl, creates a bunch of service accounts and prometheus resources from his repo

Prometheus deployment has the prometheus operator, might be worth taking a look
Also monitoring.coreos.com is being used as an API version.

Not sure if I'm a big fan of extending k8s for something so trivial as Prometheus
