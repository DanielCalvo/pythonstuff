Creates a pipeline through the UI
Adds a docker registry trigger

Creates and push another git branch
Dockerhub will puck up the new branch and build it, and when the build is complete spinnaker is going to find out about it and deploy it to k8s

Spinnaker seems cool, but it's use case seems a bit too specific (k8s only)
Also where can I define some manual steps?
