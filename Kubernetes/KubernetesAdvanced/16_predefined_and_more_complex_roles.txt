You can also create very fine-grained roles with verbs and resources defined.
A given role can allow you to view configmaps but not delete them. On the same vein, it can allow you to delete pods.
Very interesting!

So you can give access to everything except secrets for a given user.

There are some pre-defined RBAC roles: cluster-admin, admin, edit, view.
