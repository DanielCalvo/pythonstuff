Authorization controls what a user can do.

When you try to execute a command, kube-api will check to see if you have permissions to do that.

Authorization modules available:

Node: Special purpose authorization mode that authorizes API requests made by kubeletes
ABAC: Atribute-based access control. Access rights are controlled by policies that combine attributes. Ex: User "Alice" can do anything in the namespace "Marketing". ABAC does not allow very granular permission control.

RBAC: Role based access control. Regulates access using roles. Allows admins to dynamically configure permission policies.

Webhook: Sends authorization requests to an external REST interface. Interesting if you want to write your own authorization server. You can parse the incoming payload and then reply with access granted/denied.
