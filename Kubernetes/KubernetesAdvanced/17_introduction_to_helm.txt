Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes.
Helps you manage apps.
Maintained by the CNCF.

Helm uses a packaging format named charts
A chart is a collection of files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources
A single chart can deploy an app or a database.
It can have dependencies as well (ie wordpress requires mysql)

Charts use templates.
They will generate templates.
You can think of templates as dynamic yaml files which contain logic and variables.
