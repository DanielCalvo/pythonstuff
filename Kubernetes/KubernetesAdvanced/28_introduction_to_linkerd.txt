Some issues that Linkerd attemps to solve:

- It can be difficult to manage all the endpoints that make up an application within the cluster
- Service discovery in K8s is somewhat limited
- Routing is oftentimes in a round robin basis
- There's is no elaborate failure handling (except removing pods that fail their health check)
- It can be difficult to visualize the different services
- HTTPs APIs can be very basic and there's no failure handling for APIs

Linkerd can solve that apparently :o

Linkerd is a transparency proxy that adds:

- Service discovery
- Routing
- Latency aware load balancing
- It can shift traffic to do canary deployments. It can be integrated with Jenkins
- Failure handling! Using retries, deadlines and circuit breaking
- And it can add visibility with a web UI
