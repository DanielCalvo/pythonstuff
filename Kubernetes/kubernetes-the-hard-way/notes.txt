Okay, so I've done Kelsey's thing. Too much copying and pasting on that one. I wanna do it on VirtualBox.

Step 1: INITIAL SET UP
Set up two Debian 10 VirtualBox machines with their network interfaces in bridge mode on your local network.
I went absolute yolo and didn't even configure static addresses, my home router DHCP leases should be long enough. [nervous laughter]
Make sure you have your ssh public key on both machines.

Controller node IP: 192.168.1.133
Worker node IP: 192.168.1.94

Add some shortcuts to your .bashrc:
alias c1="ssh 192.168.1.133"
alias w1="ssh 192.168.1.94"

Install the following on your local:
cfssl, cfssljson, kubectl (check Kelsey's repo for details)

Also, make sure to add some host entries on the machines.

Host entries on controller1:

Host entries on worker1:

(Follow up from Dani:
- Run the cert creation and other stuff inside a container (yaml as param? in golango?)
- Ansible state for physical host set up?
)

STEP 2: CERTIFICATES FOR EVERYTHING

Run everything on this session on your local machine (not inside any VirtualBox VM)
