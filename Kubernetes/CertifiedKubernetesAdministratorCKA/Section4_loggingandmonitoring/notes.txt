54: Monitor cluster components
Node level metrics are interesting, as well as pod-level metrics, such as number of pods and their resource usage.
As of 18-Oct-2019, Kubernetes did not come with a full featured monitoring solution out of the box.

You can have a thing called "Metrics server" in your Kubernetes cluster.
It retrieves metrics from the nodes and pods, stores them and aggregates them in memory

Kubernetes runs a component called Kubelet on each node server, responsible for receiving instructions from the Kubernetes master.
The Kubelet contains a subcomponent named Container Advisor, or cAdvisor.
cAdvisor is responsible from retrieving metrics from pods and exposing them through the Kubelet API to make the metrics available for the metrics server.

You can clone the metrics server from git and then create the pods from the yaml definitions in there.


56: Managing application logs
(Follow up from Dani: You should create a container that simulates events or responds to very simple things, like telnet connections being innitiated to it!)

You can view a stream of logs with:
kubectl logs -f podname

(Follow up from Dani: Not enough logging info for a production environment. I think a follow up is definitely in order!)
