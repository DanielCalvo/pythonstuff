I'm merely following Atlassian's page on git (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud) and writing stuff here so I assimilate it better.

THE ABSOLUTE BASICS

Cloning a repo
git clone git@github.com:DanielCalvo/studies.git

To tell git to track a file or diretocty you just created:
git add Learnings

Once things have been added, removed or moved, you can commit them:
git commit  -m "adding my Learnings folder"

To push these changes:
git push origin master

The above pushes the changes to the master branch on origin. You can see your git urls with
git remote -v

To get changes from the repo, pull all:
git pull --all
Or simply pull:
git pull


BRANCHING

Lets create a branch on our project. The below command creates a branch, but does not switch to it:
git branch mytestbranch

Lets then switch to our branch:
git checkout mytestbranch

While doing this whole branch thing, I edited git.txt (this document). I'm then going to add this file to the new branch:
git add git.txt

We can then commit the stuff on our test branch:
git commit -m "adding stuff to my test branch"

Then you can do a fast forward merge:
git checkout master
git merge mytestbranch
git branch -d mytestbranch

If you do a git status, you should be ahead of master by 1 commit:
git status

On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)


We can then push our changes:
git push



To change your push/pull method to SSH:
What I think this actually does is that it overwrites the origin remote URL to be the ssh one over the https one.
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DanielCalvo/studies.git
