I'm merely following Atlassian's page on git (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud) and writing stuff here so I assimilate it better.

The absolute basics:

Cloning a repo
git clone git@github.com:DanielCalvo/studies.git

To tell git to track a file or diretocty you just created:
git add Learnings

To commit these changes:
git push origin master

The above pushes the changes to the master branch on origin. You can see your git urls with
git remote -v




To change your push/pull method to SSH:
What I think this actually does is that it overwrites the origin remote URL to be the ssh one over the https one.
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DanielCalvo/studies.git
