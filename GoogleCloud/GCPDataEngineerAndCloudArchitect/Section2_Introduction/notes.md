### 5: Lab: Using the Cloud Shell
- Cloud shell, pretty straight forward.
- `gcloud auth shell`
- `gcloud config list project`
- `gcloud -h`
- `gcloud config --help`
- `gcloud help config` (same as above with different syntax)
- `gcloud config list`
- `gcloud config list --all`
- Cloud shell is a VM that runs on gcloud with gcloud functionality
- Author encourages you to use the commands on your machine if you can

### 6: Delete unused objects
- Don't forget to clean up what you lunch when studying, otherwise it could get pretty expensive!
